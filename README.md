# Bidirectional Sound Transport
@author: CAO Chunxiao

BST Release is a sound transport demo with an implementation of the Bidirection Sound Transport
algorithm. The implementation is not intended for practical use, and the code quality is very low. For any
practical application, we recommend the programmer to implement his/her own sound renderer according
to the algorithm description in our paper.
